**AI-Powered Endurance Training Coach with Holistic Athlete Management**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Endurance athletes face a critical challenge: **balancing training intensity with adequate recovery to optimize performance while avoiding injury and burnout**. Traditional training approaches often focus solely on workout data, ignoring crucial factors like sleep quality, nutrition, and cumulative fatigue. This one-dimensional approach leads to:

- **Overtraining and injuries** due to inadequate recovery tracking
- **Suboptimal performance** from not accounting for sleep and nutrition
- **Inconsistent progress** without scientific load management
- **Guesswork-based training decisions** instead of data-driven recommendations
- **Lack of personalized coaching** that adapts to individual recovery patterns

Athletes need a comprehensive system that considers their entire physiological state—not just miles run or hours trained—to make intelligent training decisions.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Scientifically-Backed Training Metrics

Implements the **Fitness-Fatigue Model** based on peer-reviewed sports science:

- **CTL (Chronic Training Load)**: 42-day exponential moving average representing long-term fitness
- **ATL (Acute Training Load)**: 7-day exponential moving average representing short-term fatigue
- **TSB (Training Stress Balance)**: CTL - ATL, indicating form and readiness to perform
- **Recovery Score**: Combines sleep quality (50%) and training stress (50%) for holistic recovery assessment

**References**:
- Banister, E. W. (1975). "Modeling Elite Athletic Performance"
- Busso, T. (2003). "Variable dose-response relationship between exercise training and performance"
- Coggan, A. R. (2019). "Training and Racing Using a Power Meter"

### 2. AI-Powered Workout Recommendations

Our **LangGraph-based AI coach** analyzes:
- Current fitness and fatigue levels
- Recent training history (volume, intensity, frequency)
- Sleep quality and duration trends
- Nutrition adequacy
- User's experience level and goals
- Training phase (base building, peak, taper, recovery)

The AI generates **personalized workout prescriptions** including:
- Workout type (easy/tempo/interval/long/race)
- Duration and intensity zones
- Detailed rationale based on your physiological state
- Safety warnings to prevent overtraining
- Progressive overload scheduling

### 3. Comprehensive Activity Logging

**Workouts**:
- Type, duration, distance
- Average heart rate
- Automatic training load calculation with intensity multipliers

**Sleep**:
- Hours of sleep
- Quality score (1-10 subjective rating)
- Integrated into recovery calculations

**Nutrition**:
- Daily calorie intake
- Macronutrient breakdown (protein, carbs, fats)
- Future: Meal timing and pre/post-workout nutrition optimization

### 4. Intelligent Training Load Calculation

**Workout intensity multipliers based on training zone science**:
- Easy runs: 1.0x (aerobic base building)
- Tempo runs: 1.5x (lactate threshold training)
- Interval workouts: 1.8x (VO2max development)
- Long runs: 1.3x (aerobic endurance)
- Race efforts: 2.0x (maximum stress)

**Heart rate adjustments**:

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. User Logs Activities
Athletes record workouts, sleep, and nutrition through the intuitive web interface.

### 2. Training Load Calculation
Oran AI calculates training load for each workout using:
```
Training Load = Duration × Intensity Multiplier × Heart Rate Factor
```

### 3. Fitness-Fatigue Modeling
The system continuously updates:
- **CTL** (Chronic Training Load): 42-day exponential moving average
- **ATL** (Acute Training Load): 7-day exponential moving average
- **TSB** (Training Stress Balance): CTL - ATL

### 4. Recovery Assessment
Recovery score is calculated from:
```
Recovery Score = (Sleep Quality × 0.5) + (Training Stress Factor × 0.5)
```

### 5. AI Recommendation Generator
LangGraph workflow processes:
1. **Analyze**: Examine current metrics, trends, and user profile
2. **Recommend**: Generate workout prescription based on analysis
3. **Validate**: Safety check to prevent injury risk
4. **Finalize**: Save recommendation and return to user

### 6. Adaptive Learning
Every logged activity refines the AI's understanding of the athlete's response to training, enabling increasingly personalized recommendations over time.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation

Oran AI is built on validated sports science principles:

### Fitness-Fatigue Model (Banister Model)
- **Fitness**: Slowly acquired (42-day time constant), slowly lost
- **Fatigue**: Quickly acquired (7-day time constant), quickly lost
- **Form**: The difference between fitness and fatigue
- **Supercompensation**: Strategic fatigue reduction reveals peak fitness

### Training Stress Score (TSS) Methodology
- **Intensity Factor (IF)**: Workout intensity relative to threshold
- **Duration**: Time under training stress
- **Training Load**: IF² × Duration (normalized for comparison)

### Recovery Science
- Sleep quality is the #1 predictor of training adaptation (Halson, 2014)
- Inadequate recovery leads to non-functional overreaching and injury
- Monitoring HRV, sleep, and subjective wellness prevents overtraining

### Periodization Principles
- Base building: High volume, low intensity (aerobic development)
- Build phase: Increased intensity, maintained volume (lactate threshold)
- Peak phase: High intensity intervals (VO2max, neuromuscular power)
- Taper: Reduced volume, maintained intensity (supercompensation)
